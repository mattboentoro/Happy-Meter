# Happy-Meter
This Happy-Meter project is made by me and 2 other teammates during Hack Davis 2020 event. We were inspired by the use of Snapchat or Instagram Stories by people to take the selfie of their presence during their happy time, sad, or even in the time of danger. We personally think that this app function could be an important extension for Snapchat or Instagram stories to address the most important issue we are handling - mental health issue.
Isolation in one of the major concerns in this era, what if we made an app to extend a hand to those who are too afraid to reach out for help.
